# German Phrase Classification with LSTM and FastAPI

This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies German text phrases into predefined categories using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The project leverages FastAPI for serving the model via a REST API and is Dockerized for ease of deployment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning pipeline which includes:

- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Training an LSTM model for text classification.
- Developing a FastAPI application to serve the model.
- Containerizing the setup using Docker for easy deployment.


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker


## Built With

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - The web framework used
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - ML framework for training LSTM model
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerization platform
